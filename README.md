### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name's Mazlum Deniz YÃ¼ce.I'm studying mechatronics engineering at Kocaeli University.My interests are embedded software and hardware design.
For about 2 years, I worked on projects such as vehicle control system and battery management system in the efficiency challenge races organized by Teknofest.In addition, I still continue to work on these projects individually.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on embedded software with microcontrollers of companies such as STM and Atmel.
I also work with the EasyEda circuit design program on the hardware design side.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PIC and LPC series microcontrollers besides STM and Atmel on the embedded software side.On the hardware design side,I'm learning Altium Designer.
